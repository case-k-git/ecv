## Self PR
### Proposal Skill
I have been working not only on my own work but also on the overall issues and suggesting improvements based on evidence. As an example, in planning system development, search speed during planning was a bottleneck for business requirements. I felt that meeting business requirements needed to change not only from data structure and query modifications, but also from the analysis infrastructure. In parallel with the work in charge, we surveyed the analysis infrastructure that meets the requirements, visualized and proposed the performance after the transition to the relevant parties, and moved to the analysis infrastructure that met the business requirements. In PoC, we interviewed the parties concerned with business requirements and technical requirements, and organized the restrictions and requests, and proposed a system linkage and advertising product proposal agreed upon by the parties concerned.
